# BioinfoUtils 

Juber Patel's Java library with many utility classes and methods related to scientific computing in general and computational biology in particular. These utilities are used in other projects like Marianas and Waltz.   


## Dependencies (depending on which classes you want to use)

1. HTSJDK
2. Apache Commons Math
3. Google Guava


## Utilities 

1. Suffix arrays for fast search on strings (planned)
2. Bitwise representation of combinatorial data that allows for very fast iteration over vast search spaces. The combinatorial data could be sets of genomic markers, methylation markers, RNA expression values, CRISPR barcodes and so on.
2. Weibull distribution parameter estimation from data. This very useful, versatile distribution can then be used from Commons Math.
3.
